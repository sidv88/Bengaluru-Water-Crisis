                            <p>With an increase in the ongoing water crisis across the world, many water-warriors are cognizant of mindful usage.
                            But there are other factors which are leading to scarcity in the form of water leakages at places where people are not
                            aware of, non-revenue water, unauthorised connections etc. Installing Smart Water Meters(SMW) at key locations can be a
                            quick-fix solution to these issues. There is a loss of millions of litres through water leakages. Installing SMWs can
                            help us in knowing where these losses are taking place, and taking swift action can help in saving millions of litres
                            over a period of time. <br><br>
                            Smart metersuse high tech sensors to measure the water flow and report accurate results. It is wireless and sends
                            radio-frequency signals to the receiver. SEZs, large housing communities, malls etc. may consider using these for
                            they're the world's largest consumers, and no matter however accurate their piping systems are, there are chances of
                            a few leaks to happen here and there. Fixing these will help us a long way in our fight towards water conservation</p>
